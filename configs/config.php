 Portal Links

 This portal supports unlimited links.

 Please open up the file portal_links.txt in your favorite text editor.

 following format:

Don't forget the comma to separate the two values.

 For the image, please include name the appropriate PNG file the same name
 as the corresponding LINK_TITLE as that is how the script finds the right image.
